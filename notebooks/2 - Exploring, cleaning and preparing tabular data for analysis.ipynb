    "In the following two lectures our goal is to analyze a pool of loans and assess their risk. The central question is whether the loans in question are good or bad in terms of their risk. To assess whether a loan is good or bad, we try to estimate the probability of the loan (i.e. the person/company who received the loan) defaulting.\n",
    "![Good_or_bad_credit](img\\good_or_bad_credit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple approaches that usually depend on the granularity of data available.\n",
    "* Aggregated historical performance data can be used to create a high level assessment on different parts of the portfolio of loans. e.g. loans with more than 30 months maturity and more than 95% debt to income ratio are risky and we estimate 4% of them to default.\n",
    "* Loan level historical performance data can be used to create a predictive model to make a prediction on each loan individually. e.g. if we see that the borrower takes longer and longer to pay the monthly due payment, we predict they are more likely to default in the near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lecture we'll use a loan level dataset to get our hands dirty with exploration and cleaning. Next week we'll use the clean dataset we prepare today and work on creating models."

    "\n",
    "Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending company, operating in the US. It is currently the largest such platform in the world. It pioneered various aspects of this business, including registration on the SEC and offering loan trading on the secondary market. Securitization or structuring are very popular ways to fund loans when the total size of the portfolio is large. This structure serves as a way for investors (and the 'middleman') to better diversify their investments. \n"

    "It begins with the borrower. They apply for a loan and if they meet certain criteria (such as a minimum 660 FICO score) their loan is added to Lending Club’s online platform. Along with verification of the borrower's finances and other submitted information, Lending Club **assigns a grade to each loan, representing its riskiness, ie the probability of it defaulting**. This grade will also determine the interest rate the borrower has to pay (and what the investor gets). Investors can browse the loans on the platform and build a portfolio of loans. The minimum investment an investor can make is just $25 per loan. Each portion of a loan is called a note and smart investors build a portfolio of notes to spread their risk among many borrowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the borrower passes verification and if their loan is fully funded, the money (less an origination fee) will appear on their account in a couple of business days. If the borrower fails verification the loan will not be issued. It will be deleted from the platform and all money that had been invested will be returned to the respective investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Borrowers then begin making payments within 30 days. These payments will be for principal plus interest on a standard amortization schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The investors receive any payments the borrower pays to Lending Club, minus a 1% service fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "A loan can stay on the platform for up to 14 days. Most loans are funded much quicker than that and once funded, the loan will be deleted from the platform. Actually, there are 'loan sniping' algorithms and services that help investors build a portfolio of notes in mere seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "With some smart intermediate moves, Lending Club could achieve that the investors are really creditors (lenders) of Lending Club itself. This also means that if Lending Club itself goes under, investors could lose their money, even in the original loand that they funded continues to pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'notes' structure also allowed for the development of a secondary market of notes. This way investors can sell their notes to other investors or vice versa, without Lending Club itself having any say (or care) in these transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk about the methods with wich a company like Lending Club could estimate the probability of a person defaulting on the amount they borrowed, based on the information they provide along their submission.\n",
